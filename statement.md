Problem Statement:
People often follow random diets without understanding their daily calorie needs or BMI category.
There is an urgent need for a small and simple tool that can guide the busy users with basic meal suggestions based on their daily activity and body parameters.
The project aims to create a program that can calculate BMI, identify activity level based on the number of steps, estimate approximate calorie needs, and recommend three meals accordingly.

Scope of the Project:
The system is designed for:
Students
Young adults
Anyone wanting a simple daily meal guidance tool
Learners practicing Python programming
Educational purposes (not medical guidance)

Target Audience:
The Healthy Food Recommendation System is designed for:
Students who want to understand their BMI and food habits and live a healthier life.
Young adults who want simple diet suggestions based on activity levels with quick solutions.
Beginners learning Python, as the program demonstrates functions and conditional logic.
Users who track steps, such as students using smartwatches or mobile pedometers.
Individuals who want quick food guidance without advanced nutrition knowledge.
This tool is meant for educational and informational use, not medical advice.

High-Level Features:
The system provides the following major capabilities:
1. User Data Collection
Accepts age, height, weight, and steps walked.

2. BMI Calculation & Classification
Converts height to meters
Computes BMI
Categorizes into Underweight / Normal / Overweight / Obese

3. Activity Level Detection
Classifies the user into Sedentary, Lightly Active, Active, or Very Active based on steps.

4. Daily Calorie Estimation
Provides an approximate calorie requirement using age, BMI category, and activity level.

5. Meal Recommendation Engine
Suggests Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner options aligned with calorie needs.

6. Clear Output Summary
Displays all results in a structured and readable format.

7. Modular Program Structure
Uses functions for each major step, making the program easy to maintain and understand.
