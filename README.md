HEALTHY FOOD RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

OVERVIEW:
The Healthy Food Recommendation System is a Python-based program that suggests suitable breakfast, lunch, and dinner options for a user based on their BMI, age, and daily activity level. The system collects basic user information such as height, weight, age, and steps walked, calculates BMI, categorizes the activity level, estimates daily calorie needs, and provides meal recommendations.  
This project demonstrates structured problem solving, modular programming, and real-world application of basic computing concepts.

FEATURES:
- User input collection (age, height, weight, steps walked)
- BMI calculation and classification
- Activity level categorization
- Approximate calorie estimation
- Meal recommendations for:
  - Breakfast
  - Lunch
  - Dinner
- Clear terminal-based output
  Technologies / Tools Used
- Python 3
- Functions for modular design
- Conditional statements for decision-making
- GitHub for version control and repository management

 Steps to Install & Run the Project:
 clone the repository and run the program after saving it with the respective file names

To test the program effectively, try the following variations:
1. Different Age Ranges
Teenagers (below 18)
Young Adults (18–40)
Senior adults (above 40)

2. Different BMI Situations
Underweight
Normal
Overweight

3. Different Step Counts
< 5000 steps (Less active)
5000–7500 (Lightly active)
7500–10000 (active)
> 10000 (Very active)

4. Invalid Inputs
Strings instead of numbers
Negative values
